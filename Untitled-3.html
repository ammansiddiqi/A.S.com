The thing that confused scientists the most was when they would use any thing that made 
 light and got a board with two holes three inches tall one inch wide and one inch apart. 
 When the scientists saw the results they were amazed tho they didn't look at the electrons the figured that the 
electrons went through both holes at the same time but when the looked at them the went through one hole then the other 
like normal matter this is called the quantum enigma. Scientists had an idea they would look at the electrons at the last 
 second what they found was amazing when they look the say them going one then the other as if the did this since they 
can out of the light source. scientists think the electrons went back in time and went into one then the other.  
This is still a mystery even the great albert Einstein was confused by this he said 
 "I do not believe in quantum physics because I think the moon is still there when I am not looking."
