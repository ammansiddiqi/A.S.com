    Quantum Physics by Amman Siddiqi
 What is quantum physics?
  Quantum physics is the branch of physics 
  concerned with quantum theory. 
 One concern with quantum physics that confuses 
 scientists is called quantum entanglement. 
    Quantum entanglement
 is when one atom is linked to another atom and 
 they move the same way at the same time instantly 
 and they could be light years a way!
Scientists are finding ways to use Quantum entanglement for example at MIT professor 
Seth Lloyd has helped make a prototype of a quantum computer that uses quantum bits instead 
 of computer bits to make its calculations. With its quantum bits it can do many things at 
once but the one at MIT can only do easy calculations such as 2+3 or 6+3 at the same time.
The thing that confused scientists the most was when they would use any thing that made 
 light and got a board with two holes three inches tall one inch wide and one inch apart. 
 When the scientists saw the results they were amazed tho they didn't look at the electrons the figured that the 
electrons went through both holes at the same time but when the looked at them the went through one hole then the other 
like normal matter this is called the quantum enigma. Scientists had an idea they would look at the electrons at the last 
 second what they found was amazing when they look the say them going one then the other as if the did this since they 
can out of the light source. scientists think the electrons went back in time and went into one then the other.  
This is still a mystery even the great albert Einstein was confused by this he said 
 "I do not believe in quantum physics because I think the moon is still there when I am not looking."
