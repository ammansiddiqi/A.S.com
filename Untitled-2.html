    Seth Lloyd has helped make a prototype of a quantum computer that uses quantum bits instead 
    of computer bits to make its calculations. With its quantum bits it can do many things at 
   once but the one at MIT can only do easy calculations such as 2+3 or 6+3 at the same time.
   The thing that confused scientists the most was when they would use any thing that made 
 light and got a board with two holes three inches tall one inch wide and one inch apart. 
 When the scientists saw the results they were amazed tho they didn't look at the electrons the figured that the 
electrons went through both holes at the same time but when the looked at them the went through one hole then the other 
like normal matter this is called the quantum enigma. Scientists had an idea they would look at the electrons at the last
